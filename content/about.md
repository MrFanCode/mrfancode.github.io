# ABOUT

I'm Irfan,

When I was 14 years old, I began programming. I began with JS, CSS, and HTML. I gained knowledge in Bash script, Python, C++, Linux, Digital Forensics, and Cryptography. Additionally, I also like to solve CTF challenges on CTFLearn, TryHackMe, PicoCTF, HackTheBox, and OverTheWire.

I just learned all of this on my own just through the open-source/publicly available information on the internet.


#### The purpose of this blog

I would like to keep a record of everything I do in the IT industry, such as my coding projects, any automation I find fascinating online, cybersecurity-related tips and tricks I find incredible, and [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) challenges I solve. However, I would primarily use some online hints for learning purposes, so if I identify anything from the internet, I will acknowledge the page.


##### Feel free to look me up on other platforms.
