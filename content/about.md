# ABOUT

I'm Irfan,

I am just a young student who started programming at the age of 14. I started with HTML, CSS, and JS. Now in 2025, I learned Linux, Python, C++, and Bash script. I have also done some CTF challenges on HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PicoCTF, OverTheWire, and CTFLearn.


I have never taken my computer science subject in high school or followed any paid course. 
I just learned all of this on my own just through the open-source information on the internet.


#### The purpose of this blog

I would like to keep a record of everything I do in the IT industry, such as my coding projects, any automation I find fascinating online, cybersecurity-related tips and tricks I find incredible, and CTF challenges I solve. However, I would primarily use some online hints for learning purposes, so if I identify anything from the internet, I will acknowledge the page.


##### Feel free to look me up on other platforms.
